	   <h2>2D Platform Game -- <a target="_blank"
	       href="https://github.com/notverywise/Calculator">Github Repo</a></h2>
	   <p>This game was a project my friend and I developed during our senior
	       year of high school. The screenshots on the right show the UI of the
	       game. In the bottom left of the screenshots of the game, you will see
	       a blue square. This square is controllable by the player. The goal of
	       the game was to get the blue square all the way to the top of the
	       screen. However, the following obstacles are in the way:</p>
	   <ul>
	       <li>Black Rectangles: The player can not pass through these. They act
	           as walls and platforms guiding the player. Some of these
	           platforms can move, either up and down, or left and right.</li>
	       <li>Red Rectangles: If the player touches these, they are sent back
	           to the start of the game. Conceptually, these act like lava and a
	           dangerous hazard that must be avoided.</li>
	       <li>Green Rectangles: These rectangles function similarly to the
	           black rectangles, except that they can disappear. They are set on
	           a timer to loop from an "appeared" state to a "disappeared"
	           state, and their color changes throughout this loop.</li>
	   </ul>
	   <p>While developing this game, I was in charge creating the user
	       interface of the game, the level structure, bounding the platforms,
	       and performance optimization.</p>

	   <h2>Hyland Hackathon Submission -- <a target="_blank"
           href="https://github.com/BoomBanger/DungeonMastery">Github Repo</a>
       </h2>
       <p>This was a project my friend and I developed during a Hackathon hosted
           Hyland Software. This Hackathon had a 48-hr time limit, and took
           place in April, 2022. We created a map-creation software that
           was designed to be useful for D&D players, and other tabletop games.

	   <h2>Personal Calculator -- <a target="_blank"
           href="https://github.com/notverywise/Calculator">Github Repo</a></h2>
       <p>This calculator was the first project I ever developed. I worked on it
           alone in 2021. While it is not a finished calculator, it contains a
           couple of particularly convenient features. For example, the
           calculator offers dynamically changing buttons. This means that that
           the buttons can disable themselves if the current input in the
           calculator could pose a problem when processing. Take the input "78+".
           In the top picture, you can see that all of the operation buttons are
           disabled. The calculator sees that the current input ends in an
           operation, and thus disables all operation buttons from being pressed
           to prevent two operation symbols being typed next to each other.
           Similarly, the decimal point can only be pressed if the current
           number does not already have a decimal point in it. This is shown in
           the second picture. Given that this is my oldest project, it is the
           least reflective of my current capabilities as a programmer, however,
           it still offers some insight into a couple of my skills: </p>
       <ul>
           <li>I have been working with GUIs and user based applications for
               several years now.</li>
           <li>I like to pursue useful features in programs I write. The dynamic
               buttons are an example of this.</li>
           <li>I am a motivated and hard-working individual. I wrote this
               program in the summer before I was a senior in high school, a
               long time before I received formal education in computer science.
           </li>
       </ul>
       <p>It should be noted that since creating this project, I have created
           another working calculator for one of my classes at OSU
           (CSE 2221 - Software 1) using Java. Details for the project can be
           found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/assignments/projects/natural-number-calculator/natural-number-calculator.html">
